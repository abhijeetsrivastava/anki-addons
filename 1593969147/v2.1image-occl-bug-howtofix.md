Sorry!!
There was a bug in previous version of the addon 'Image Style Editor'.
When editing image sizes in image occlusion notes, it made all the cards of the note have the same occlusion masks.
A total of %d notes were found affected by the bug, and they were tagged "image-style-occl-bugged".

To fix your notes, please do the following: 
1. Click Browse, search for "tag:image-style-occl-bugged" (without quotes)
2. For each note, remove "image-style-occl-bugged" tag, then press 'Edit Image Occlusion'(Ctrl + Shift + O) on top right. 
3. Move one of the masks by 1mm. There needs to be a change to the note.
4. Click 'Edit Cards' on the bottom.
